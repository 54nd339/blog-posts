### The Digital Transformation: Digitization Concepts
How does a beautiful sunset photograph, your favorite song, or an old home movie get into a computer? Through **digitization**! This is the fundamental process of converting analog information (continuous signals from the real world) into a digital format (discrete numerical data – 0s and 1s) that computers can understand, store, and manipulate.

Key concepts in digitization include:

* **Sampling (for audio/video):** Taking measurements (samples) of an analog signal at regular intervals. The higher the sampling rate (samples per second), the more accurately the digital version represents the original analog signal. For images, sampling relates to the resolution or number of pixels.
* **Quantization:** Assigning a discrete numerical value to each sample from a predefined range of possible values. The number of bits used for quantization (bit depth) determines the number of possible values and thus the fidelity or quality (e.g., number of colors in an image, dynamic range of audio).

Understanding digitization is crucial because it directly impacts the quality, file size, and processing requirements of multimedia elements. It also lays the groundwork for concepts like compression, which we'll tackle later in this series!

### Multimedia Everywhere: Application Domains ️
